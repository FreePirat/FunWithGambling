Currently, 3 games are fully created with JavaScript and tied to the website. These games are:

### 1. Poker ###

The classic Texas Hold 'em game we all know and love, where you face off against a computer. You can call to bet the current amount of money, bet a higher amount of money or fold to give up if the cards aren't in your favour.

### 2. Slots ###

A slot machine that displays emojis for the spinners. The neon style and nice visuals make for a clean yet simple game.

### 3. Blackjack ###

Try to get as close to 21 as you can, but be careful, going over means you lose automatically. You also face a computer that has the same goal as you.
